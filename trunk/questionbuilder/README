This project produces all the plausible new questions from a a given QRM.  This is done in four steps.

1) The orignal natural language question is broken down in to terms via a chunker.
2) The terms from step 1 are mapped to the inputs of webforms in the QRM.
3) The Terms in the questions are replaces with other possible choices that were used in the webform.
4) These new questions are printed to standard out.
