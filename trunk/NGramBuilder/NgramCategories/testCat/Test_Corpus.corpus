Car tuning is both an industry and a hobby, in which an automobile, motor bike, scooter or moped is modified in order to improve its performance, handling and presentation and improve the owner's driving style. As most vehicles leave the factory set up for average driver expectations and average conditions, tuning has become a way to personalize the characteristics of the vehicle to the owner's preference. For example, they may be altered to provide better fuel economy, produce more power at high RPM or the ride comfort may be sacrificed to provide better handling.
Car tuning is related to auto racing, although most performance cars never compete. Rather they are built for the pleasure of owning and driving such a vehicle. Another major facet of tuning includes performance modification to the car exterior. This includes changing the aerodynamic characteristics of the vehicle via side skirts, front and rear bumpers, adding spoilers, splitters, air vents and light weight wheels.
Is a term used to describe the sound or video system fitted in the vehicle. A stock audio system refers to one that was specified by the manufacturer when the vehicle was built. A custom audio installation can involve anything from the upgrade of the radio to a full-blown customization based around the audio equipment. Events are held where entrants compete for the loudest, highest quality reception or most innovative sound systems.
Interior tuning is a term used for modifying of the interior of a car. for example; removing the back seats to make room for a sound system, or taking out the front seats and replacing them with racing seats - commonly known as bucket seats.
Another recent form of interior tuning is the replacement of the OEM Shift Knob with an aftermarket version such as a weighted shift knob for cosmetic and/or for performance purposes.
Engine tuning as of lately has been marketed as the replacement of basic engine components with aftermarket versions that perform the same functions as those replaced while promising an increase in power output. Car tuners usually install new turbochargers, modify the car's engine cooling unit, and replace the air filters; but they could also install a more powerful engine on the cars they modify.
For example a tuner could modify the engine control unit to gain more power. Another example is the modification and/or replacement of the OEM manual transmission stick shift (also known as a gear stick) with an optimized aftermarket design known as a short shifter. For further "fine" tuning, the driver could fit a Weighted Gear Knob.
Suspension tuning involves modifying the springs, shock absorbers, swaybars, and other related components of a vehicle. Shorter springs offer greater stiffness, a lower center of gravity, and a lowered look. Stiffer shock absorbers improve the dynamic weight shifting during cornering and normally have shorter internals to stop them from bottoming out when shorter springs are used. Stiffer sway bars reduce body roll during cornering, thus improving the grip that the inside tires have on the surface; this improves handling response. Other components that are sometimes added are strut bars, which improve the body stiffness and help better maintain the proper suspension geometry during cornering. On some cars certain braces, anti-roll bars, etc., can be retrofitted to lower-spec cars from sports models.
For offroad vehicles, the emphasis is on lengthening the suspension travel and larger tires to increase ground clearance.

The SA was Toyota's first new passenger car design (as opposed to updating the AA) after World War II. It was the first in a family of vehicles before the introduction of the Crown. A series of light trucks also shared the chassis and major components of these passenger cars.
All of these vehicles were sold under the Toyopet name.
The SA was Toyota's first true post war design. It differed from all previous Toyota cars by having a 4 cylinder engine (previously a 6 cylinder was used), 4 wheel independent suspension (previously using rigid axles with leaf springs) and a smaller, aerodynamic body. The project was driven by Kiichiro Toyoda under the wisdom of his father's (Sakichi Toyoda) words, "Stay ahead of the times"[2] but most of the design work was done by Dr Kazuo Kumabe.[3]
The body was aerodynamic in a style similar to the Volkswagen Beetle. Only a two door sedan was made, making it unsuitable for the taxi market. The doors were arranged to open rearwards (often called suicide doors). The front window was a single pane of flat glass with a single wiper mounted above the driver. Only right hand drive was offered.
Toyota engineers (including Dr Kumabe) had visited Germany before World War II and had studied the 16 cylinder Auto Union racing car (independent suspension) and Porsche and Volkswagen designs (independent suspension, aerodynamic bodies, backbone chassis, rear mounted air cooled engines, economical production cost)[4]. Many Japanese companies had ties with Germany during the war years but most partnered with British or American companies after the war and thus used technologies commonly used in Britain or America. But Toyota did not partner with a foreign company, so it was free to use German designs. Many features of the prototype Beetle were subsequently put into the SA, although the Beetle's rear mounted air cooled engine feature was not used. Later on, Toyota revisited the economic principles exemplified by the Beetle when designing the Publica and the Corolla.
Although permission to begin full production of passenger cars in Japan was not granted until 1949, limited numbers of cars were permitted to be built from 1947, and the Toyota SA was one such car [4][5][6]. Design work started at the end of 1945 when the GHQ let it be known that authorised commercial production of vehicles for the general public would be commencing soon. This model was introduced in January 1947, with a prototype (which had been under development for more than a year) being completed at that time.[2]
Production occurred from October 1947 through May 1952 (overlapping with the 1949-introduced SD), with a total of only 215 being built [7]. The first car to be produced by Toyota in the postwar period was the AC, which had first been produced in 1943-1944. Fifty were built for government and military use in 1947, and three more were assembled in 1948. Since only 54 cars were built by Toyota in 1947, this leaves four Model SA production cars to be built at the end of that year, not counting the prototype.
Eighteen SA cars were built in 1948, and from 1949â€“1952, 193 more were built. No breakdown exists between models after 1948; only yearly passenger-car grand totals are extant.
This model introduced the Type S straight-4 water cooled engine, conventionally mounted in the front of the car and driving through the rear wheels. Two small grills at the front allowed air for the engine's radiator. Transmission was by a 3 speed manual gearbox and a Hotchkiss drive[4] (previous Toyotas used a torque tube) to a rear mounted differential. The final drive gear ratio was 7.17:1 .
More unconventional was the use of a backbone chassis and four wheel independent suspension. A-arm suspension (short upper arm, long lower arm) with coils was used at the front and swing axle suspension with semi-trailing arms, Panhard rods and a transverse semi-elliptical leaf spring was used at the rear.
A light truck using the running gear from the SA but with a ladder chassis and solid axles front and rear, both with semi-elliptical springs. The SB was popular with the general public and also with the American occupation forces, which ordered it in large numbers.[4]
The SB was offered with commercial bodies only but many dealers and owners had sedan bodies made for them.[2][4] Toyota contracted the Kanto Denki factory to produced a sedan body and wagon on the SB chassis as the SC.
A small number of police cars were made by adding a special body with a canvas top, 4 canvas doors and a fold down front window for the Japanese Police Reserve Force but they were not popular.[8]

Produced from 1947.
The SB used the same engine and gearbox as the SA. A conventional ladder frame chassis was used with conventional semi-elliptical springs and solid axles front and rear.
The SB light truck was offered with commercial bodies only but many dealers and owners had sedan bodies made for them.[2][4] Toyota contracted the Kanto Denki factory to produced a 4-door, 4-seat sedan body and wagon on the SB chassis as the SC.[9] However, production of the SA sedan continued and the SC was not put into production. When production of the SA stopped, a revised version of the SC was made as the SD.
3 prototypes were built but the SC did not go into production.[10]
Same as the SB except for independent front suspension.[9]
A 5-seater passenger car using the same chassis and suspension as the SB.[10]
Produced from November 1949 to 1951.
Same as the SB.
An update to the SD.
Produced from October 1951[2] to 1953.
Same as the SD.
An update to the SB, sharing components with the SF.
Produced from March 1952[9] to 1954.
Same as the SF.
A further update to the SF but with the newly designed Type R engine.[9] The RHN's body was made by the New Mitsubishi Heavy Industrial Manufacturing Co. and the RHK's body was made by Kanto Auto Work, Ltd.[11]
The RH was also made into BH26 Police Patrol Car and the BH28 Ambulance by using the Type B 6 cylinder engine and a longer front end. The RH was succeeded by the similar 1955 RR Master and the much more modern 1955 RS Crown.
The RH was also known as the Super.
Produced from September 1953 to 1955.
