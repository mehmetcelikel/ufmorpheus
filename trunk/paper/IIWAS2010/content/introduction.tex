When traveling though a jungle to a destination, it is easy to get
lost.  The first person to go somewhere may make a number of mistakes
in trying to find the best path to their destination.  However, those
who come later will find it easier to reach that destination if a
well-marked trail has been created. Olsen and Malizia describe this
idea as \emph{exploiting trails} \cite{5379671}.  Rather than treating
a user's discovery experience as a unique entity and working without an example
context, one can exploit the fact that a similar search may have already been
performed.  In one study, almost 40 percent of all queries
were found to be repetitions of previous queries\cite{1277770}. This
indicates the reuse of prior searches is a way to optimize the search
process.  Morpheus is a question answering system motivated by reuse of prior
web search pathways to yield an answer to a user query. Using our analogy,
Morpheus follows path-finders to their destinations and not only marks the
trail, but also provides a taxi service to take followers to similar
destinations.


The Morpheus system employs two distinct user roles. One role is a
\textit{path finder} who enters queries in the Morpheus web interface and
searches for an answer to the query using an instrumented web browser. 
This web tracking tool stores the query
and necessary information to revisit the pathways to the page where the guide 
found the answer. The other role is a \textit{path follower}, who uses the Morpheus system much like a regular search engine with a natural language interface. The path follower enters a question in a text box and receives a guided path to the answer. The system exploits previously found paths to provide an answer.

To exploit prior paths, Morpheus represents user-query details in a format called a Semi-Structured Query or \textit{SSQ}. It includes a user query in natural-language format, relevant terms for the query, and place holders for the term \textit{categories}. A \textit{category} represents a
topic or class to which a term belongs. For example, the term \textit{tire} can be classified into the category \textit{Automotive Part}.

Morpheus assumes the term categories are classes of a
\textit{consistent} realm-based ontology. We define a consistant ontology to have the following two properties. First, a singly-rooted heterarchy that has an acyclic digraph with unique ancestor of all nodes. Second, subclass and superclass relations must have meaningful semantic interpretations. This is important because, our proposed similarity 
measure for categories is based on the heterarchically
structured category ontologies. Moreover, when a regular user enters a query,
Morpheus ranks SSQs in the store based on this catgeory similarity. Suppose a
regular user asks -\textit{ a 1997 Toyota Camry V6 needs what size tires?} In
this query, identifying \textit{Camry V6} as a subclass of \textit{Toyota} cars
and a predecessor of \textit{automobile models} is important, because this will
help us grouping stored queries. Similarly, a clean ontology-taxonomy can
improve the recall of such queries by supporting transitivity and other types of
inference like faceted browsing \cite{Wu2008}.   


This paper starts by discussing state-of-the-art systems in the area of
question answering and ontology generation. The system
architecture section explains the Morpheus system and its implementations
details. In the results section, we describe current results and its
interpretations. Finally, we conclude the paper by describing the global impacts
of our approaches in QA systems.
