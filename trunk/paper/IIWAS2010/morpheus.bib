@PhDThesis{Suchanek2009phd,
	abstract = {"An ontology is a computer-processable collection of knowledge about the world. This PhD thesis explains how an ontology can be constructed and expanded auto-matically. The proposed approach consists of three contributions: 1. A core ontology, YAGO. YAGO is an ontology that has been constructed automatically. It combines high accuracy with large coverage and serves as a core that can be expanded. 2. A tool for information extraction, LEILA. LEILA is a system that can extract knowledge from natural language texts. LEILA will be used to 2nd new facts for YAGO. 3. An integration mechanism, SOFIE. SOFIE is a system that can reason on the plausibility of new knowledge. SOFIE will assess the facts found by LEILA and integrate theminto YAGO. Each of these components comes with a fully implemented system. Together,they form an integrative architecture, which does not only gather new facts,but also reconcile them with the existing facts. The result is an ever-growing,yet highly accurate ontological knowledge base. A survey of applications of theontology completes the thesis."},

	abstract={In the virtual world, implemented by the Internet, Web, satellite navigation, and other technologies, people are also roaming around that exploits the knowledge of others by following their trails. The advantage of utilizing trails is that they are adaptive, systems can catch all types of trails, and the program only has to distinguishes trails-it does not have to comprehend the common goals of all these users. The paper exploits the idea of a trail, presents a set of examples, and discusses what extent the concept may be used in the virtual world. It also presents a simple case implementation of a trail detection system. The author concluded that thebasic idea is to utilize the knowledge and decisions of others in order to find a good solution faster. The raw data that is needed is there already, often internally to the site, but some Web sites are willing to share this data with their users.},
