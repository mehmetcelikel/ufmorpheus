	abstract={In the virtual world, implemented by the Internet, Web, satellite navigation, and other technologies, people are also roaming around that exploits the knowledge of others by following their trails. The advantage of utilizing trails is that they are adaptive, systems can catch all types of trails, and the program only has to distinguishes trails-it does not have to comprehend the common goals of all these users. The paper exploits the idea of a trail, presents a set of examples, and discusses what extent the concept may be used in the virtual world. It also presents a simple case implementation of a trail detection system. The author concluded that thebasic idea is to utilize the knowledge and decisions of others in order to find a good solution faster. The raw data that is needed is there already, often internally to the site, but some Web sites are willing to share this data with their users.},
